# Base64-encoding

# opcode.cpp

In this code, we first encode the text data using bc::encode_base16 function, which converts the data into a hexadecimal string. We then create a bc::data_chunk with the encoded data and use it to construct a Bitcoin script using the bc::script constructor. We create a transaction output using the script, and finally output the serialized transaction output using the to_data method.

# encode.cpp

This code defines a base64_encode function that takes a string as input and returns the Base64-encoded string. To include the encoded text in a Bitcoin transaction, you would need to create a transaction output with a script that includes the encoded data. The script can be created using the OP_RETURN opcode, which allows you to attach up to 80 bytes of data to a Bitcoin transaction.
