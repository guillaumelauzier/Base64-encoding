# Base64-encoding

# opcode.cpp

In this code, we first encode the text data using bc::encode_base16 function, which converts the data into a hexadecimal string. We then create a bc::data_chunk with the encoded data and use it to construct a Bitcoin script using the bc::script constructor. We create a transaction output using the script, and finally output the serialized transaction output using the to_data method.

# encode.cpp

This code defines a base64_encode function that takes a string as input and returns the Base64-encoded string. To include the encoded text in a Bitcoin transaction, you would need to create a transaction output with a script that includes the encoded data. The script can be created using the OP_RETURN opcode, which allows you to attach up to 80 bytes of data to a Bitcoin transaction.

# utf-8.cpp

In this example, we create a string text containing the text we want to convert to binary data. We then create a vector of uint8_t (8-bit unsigned integers) called binary_data. We use the vector constructor to convert the characters in text to their binary representation using UTF-8 encoding.

Finally, we output the binary data in hexadecimal format using a loop that iterates over each byte in the vector. The static_cast<int> is used to convert the uint8_t byte to an int so that it can be printed in hexadecimal format using std::hex.

  # output
  
  The function text_to_binary should return a vector of bytes (std::vector<uint8_t>) that represents the binary data of the input text encoded in UTF-8. For example, if the input text is "Hello, world!", the function should return a vector containing the following bytes in hexadecimal notation:

```48 65 6c 6c 6f 2c 20 77 6f 72 6c 64 21```

Note that these bytes represent the ASCII codes of the characters in the input text, since ASCII is a subset of UTF-8.
